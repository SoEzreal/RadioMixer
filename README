INSTALLATION
==================

The installation of the RadioMixer is very simple.
Just use the normal CMake way to build it:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make install

-You're done!-


NOTES
==================

We recommend to Install with JackD support as this is the way the RadioMixer can be used
with all its features.

Vorbis an libMAD support are also recommended, but not as important as the JackD support.
